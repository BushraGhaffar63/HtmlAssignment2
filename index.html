    <h1>Essay on Why to Boycott Israel Products</h1>
    <p lang="eng-us">
        Israel has <b>killed over 21,000 Palestinians</b> since <i>October 7, 2023</i>. This includes a huge number of
        children and
        women. Most of the people killed in this war are civilians, including journalists. Israel blames Hamas for its
        recent genocide in the Gaza Strip. However, many, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, hold that the
        Hamas attacks did not happen in isolation,
        as they were the result of decades of oppression and occupation.

        Moreover, it is being claimed by many experts that Israel is committing this ethnic cleansing in Gaza to build
        the Ben-Gurion Canal around the Gaza Strip to achieve its economic aims and decrease dependence on the Suez
        Canal. Different international food chains and brands have been supporting Israel in its war crimes and
        apartheid in Gaza. This has sparked outrage among pro-Palestinian people all all across the world.<br>

        Israels technological advancement, its support by the United States and some other European nations, disharmony
        among the <strong>Muslim states</strong>, and its weak military strength have coerced the pro-Palestinian people
        to look for other means to stop Israels atrocities. Hence, the call for a boycott of pro-Israel and Israeli products has
        become an effective way to protest against Israels massacre in Palestinian land.
        For this purpose, the Palestinian people have developed the <strong>“Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction (BDS)
        movement.”</strong>

        This Palestinian movement has enlisted numerous <strong>pro-Israel products</strong> that weak Muslim nations
        should boycott to support Palestine. Although the divestment campaign against Israeli companies has been labeled anti-Semitic by
        sympathizers of Israel, a host of<em>famous personalities, including celebrities</em>, have joined it. Amidst
        this new wave of Israeli Israeli violations of international law in the <b>Gaza war</b>, the BDS movement has resurfaced.
        People around the world are boycotting the brands that, directly or indirectly, are supporting Israel in its genocidal
        campaign in Gaza.</br>
        This boycott of Israeli products has resulted in colossal losses for many of these brands.

        As per reports,<b>Starbucks has faced a huge loss of more than $11 billion due to this boycott</b>

        he debate in Pakistan reached a new zenith during the <strong>Pakistan Super League (PSL)</strong>
        when people were barred from taking Palestinian placards, and posters inside the stadium. KFCs sponsorship of
        the PSL also sparked outrage among the people of the country.</br>
        People were not even allowed to raise slogans in support of Palestine and Palestinian rights, and the Pakistan
        Cricket Board (PCB) came under fire due to these moves.
